# 📘 Age Check — Legal Age Verification Using If-Else

This folder contains a simple age verification example designed to learn the if-else conditional structure in Java. The program determines whether a user is legally an adult based on the entered age value and prints the result to the console. This example is an ideal starting point for understanding the basic usage of conditional statements.

---

## 🔍 How the Logic Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their age.
2. The entered value is evaluated using the condition `age >= 18`.
3. If the condition is true: “You are an adult.”
4. If the condition is false: “You are underage.”
5. The program prints the result to the console.

This structure demonstrates how the if-else mechanism in Java makes decisions through a simple example.

## 🧠 Java Concepts Learned

- Taking user input (`Scanner`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Building simple control mechanisms using decision structures

## 🚀 Extension Ideas

- Displaying different messages based on age groups (e.g., child, teenager, adult)
- Validating negative or invalid age input
- Adding multiple conditions using `else if`
