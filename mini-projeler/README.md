# 📁 Mini Projects — Console-Based Applications

This folder contains small yet educational **Java console projects** developed using core Java concepts.  
Each project focuses on a simple real-world problem and is designed with clear logic and user interaction in mind.  
As the projects progress, the complexity of control structures and problem-solving techniques increases.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Transform fundamental Java concepts into real applications  
- Practice if–else and switch–case decision structures  
- Develop programs that interact with user input  
- Document the learning process in a structured and readable way

## ▶️ SmartCityAssistant — Smart City Services Assistant

This project is a Java console application that provides multiple services through a menu system, including:
**taxi fare calculation**, **electricity bill calculation**, and **health analysis (BMI & ideal weight)**.

The program collects user input and performs different calculations based on the selected service.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Validation and control using if–else  
- Menu management with switch–case  
- Handling multiple user inputs  
- Mathematical calculations  
- Presenting results via console output  

### 📤 Sample Flow
Username: Irem  
Create PIN: 1234  
Enter PIN: 1234  

1-Taxi  2-Electricity  3-Health  
Choice: 1  

Distance (km): 10  
Time (day/night): day  
Weekend (yes/no): no  

Taxi Fare: $18.00

## ▶️ Guess the Number — GuessNumber Game (Enhanced)

This project is an interactive console game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100.  
The game includes additional rules to control invalid user behavior.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Random number generation (`Math.random()`)  
- Repetitive input handling using a while loop  
- Input validation (range checking)  
- User guidance through warning messages  

### 📤 Sample Flow
Your guess: 150  
Invalid input! Please enter a number between 0 and 100.

## ▶️ Quadratic Equation Solver

This project analyzes and solves equations of the form
**ax² + bx + c = 0** based on user-provided coefficients.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Mathematical problem analysis  
- Discriminant (Delta) calculation  
- Nested if–else structures  
- Formatted numerical output  

### 📤 Sample Flow
Enter coefficients:  
1  -3  2  

Delta: 1  
x1: 2.00  
x2: 1.00

## ▶️ How to Run

Each project is located in its own folder.  
You can run the corresponding `Main.java` (or main class) file to interact with the application via the console.
