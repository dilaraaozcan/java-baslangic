# 📁 Loops — Loop Structures in Java

This folder contains Java console applications designed to reinforce the logic of loop structures such as *while*, *do-while*, and *for* loops.  
Each subproject focuses on a specific algorithmic problem to demonstrate how loops are used in practical and meaningful scenarios.

The goal of this folder is to strengthen algorithmic thinking and provide hands-on practice with repetitive operations in Java.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- 🔄 Learn loop logic through real examples  
- 🔁 Apply repetitive operations in problem-solving  
- 🧮 Practice mathematical and logical algorithms using Java  
- 🧠 Combine numeric values, conditions, and loops effectively

## 📂 Subprojects

### 1️⃣ Factorial Calculation
A simple application that calculates the factorial of a positive integer using a *while* loop.  
It reinforces the concept of repeated multiplication and loop-controlled iteration.

Key concepts:
- while loop
- cumulative multiplication
- user input handling

---

### 2️⃣ Armstrong Number Checker
An application that determines whether a given number is an Armstrong number.  
It uses a *while* loop and *Math.pow()* to calculate the sum of digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

Key concepts:
- digit extraction
- mathematical operations
- while loop with numeric manipulation

---

### 3️⃣ Prime Number Checker
A loop-based algorithm that checks whether a given integer is a prime number using a *for* loop.  
The program tests divisibility starting from 2 and applies early termination if a divisor is found.

Key concepts:
- for loop
- modulo operator (%)
- early exit strategy
- conditional logic

## 🧑‍💻 Note

This folder serves as a centralized collection of loop-based algorithm examples.  
As new loop-related projects are added, this README will be revised to maintain consistency and clarity.
