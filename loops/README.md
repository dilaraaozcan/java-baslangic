# 📁 Loops — Loop Structures in Java

This folder contains example applications designed to reinforce the logic of *while*, *do-while*, and *for* loops in Java.  
It was created to demonstrate how repetitive operations are used in programming and to provide hands-on practice with basic algorithms.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- 🔄 Learn loop logic through practical examples  
- 🔁 Apply repetitive operations in programming  
- 🧮 Practice solving mathematical algorithms using Java  
- 🧠 Learn to combine numeric values, conditions, and loops effectively

## 📂 Subprojects

### 1️⃣ Factorial Calculation
An application that calculates the factorial of a number using a simple *while* loop.  
The program takes a number from the user and multiplies values starting from 1 to produce the result.

### 2️⃣ Armstrong Number Checker
An application that determines whether a given number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.  
This example reinforces algorithmic thinking using a *while* loop together with *Math.pow()*.
