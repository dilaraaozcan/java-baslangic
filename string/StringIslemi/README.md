# 📝 String Operations — Basic Text Manipulation in Java

This project is a simple Java console application that performs fundamental **string operations** on text entered by the user.  
It demonstrates how to work with the `String` data type, access characters, and manipulate text using loops and built-in methods.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

- Understand basic string manipulation in Java  
- Practice character access and length-based operations  
- Learn uppercase and lowercase transformations  
- Implement manual string reversal using a loop  
- Reinforce algorithmic thinking with text-based examples  

---

## 🧠 What the Program Does

- Takes a text input from the user  
- Converts the text to **uppercase**  
- Converts the text to **lowercase**  
- Extracts and prints:
  - The **first character**
  - The **last character**
- Reverses the text **manually** using a `for` loop  
- Prints all results to the console  

---

## 🧠 Java Concepts Practiced

- Reading user input with `Scanner`  
- String case conversion (`toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`)  
- Character access using `charAt()`  
- Length calculation with `length()`  
- Loop-based string reversal  
- Console output formatting

## 💡 Example Execution

Input:
Hello World

Output:
Uppercase: HELLO WORLD  
Lowercase: hello world  
First character: H  
Last character: d  
Reversed text: dlroW olleH
