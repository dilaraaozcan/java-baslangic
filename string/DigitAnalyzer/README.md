# 🔢 DigitAnalyzer — Numeric Character Analysis System

This project is a mini algorithm that analyzes a user-provided number **as a string**.  
The main goal is to examine the number character by character and extract its mathematical properties through algorithmic processing.

## 🎯 What the Program Does

- Calculates the sum of all digits  
- Finds the largest digit  
- Counts how many digits are even and odd  
- Checks whether the number contains **0**  
- Reverses the number  
- Determines whether the number is a **palindrome**  

The program is implemented using `charAt()`, ASCII-based calculations (`'0'` offset), loops, and basic control structures.
