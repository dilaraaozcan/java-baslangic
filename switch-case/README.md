# 📁 switch-case — Menu and Decision Structures

This folder contains two mini projects designed to reinforce the use of the switch-case structure in Java through realistic scenarios: a console-based menu system and a mathematical brain teaser application.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Practice switch-case structures in real use cases
- Present multiple options to the user
- Design nested decision-making mechanisms
- Apply menu logic in practical scenarios
- Combine mathematical problem-solving with Java

---

# ▶️ 1. Menu.java — Console-Based Menu System

This application presents three options to the user:

1. **Login System** — Username and password verification  
2. **Calculator** — Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
3. **Exit** — Safe program termination  

### 🧠 Logic Overview

- User selections are handled using switch-case
- Nested switch-case structures are used for calculator operations
- Division-by-zero checks are implemented

---

# ▶️ 2. BrainTeaserPicker — Mathematical Brain Teaser (Switch-Case)

This mini project presents a mathematical question based on the difficulty level selected by the user and validates the answer.

## 🧠 Difficulty Levels and Questions

### 1️⃣ Easy
Sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, ?  
Correct answer → **10**

---

### 2️⃣ Medium
How many times do the hour and minute hands overlap in one hour?  
Correct answer → **1**

---

### 3️⃣ Hard
When a number is multiplied by 6 and 9 is subtracted, the result is 20 more than when the same number is multiplied by 3 and 4 is added.  
Correct answer → **11**

---

### 4️⃣ Extreme
When 4 is added to three times a positive integer, the result is 10 less than five times the number.  
Correct answer → **7**
