# 🧠 BrainTeaserPicker — Switch-Case Brain Teaser Application

This mini project is an interactive brain teaser application designed to teach the **switch-case** structure in Java through a real-world scenario. The user selects a difficulty level between 1 and 4 and attempts to answer a mathematical logic question associated with that level.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Learn switch-case usage through a practical example  
- Practice user input handling, conditional checks, and decision structures  
- Combine mathematical problem-solving with programming  
- Develop an interactive application with multiple difficulty levels

## 📌 Content (Questions and Difficulty Levels)

### **1️⃣ Easy**
2, 4, 6, 8, ?  
Correct answer → **10**

### **2️⃣ Medium**
How many times do the hour and minute hands overlap in one hour?  
Correct answer → **1**

### **3️⃣ Hard**
6x − 9 is **20 greater** than 3x + 4.  
Equation:  
6x − 9 = 3x + 24  
Correct answer → **11**

### **4️⃣ Extreme**
3x + 4 = 5x − 10  
Correct answer → **7**

## ▶️ How to Run

Simply run the `Main.java` file using a Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA).  
The user will be prompted to select a difficulty level and answer the corresponding question.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Multi-branch decision making with switch-case  
- Taking user input with `Scanner`  
- Validating correct and incorrect answers using conditional logic  
- Implementing mathematical logic problems in code
