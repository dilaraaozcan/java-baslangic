# 📘 Grade Calculator – Java Console Application

This project is a simple **Java console application** that calculates the course average, letter grade, and a short description based on the user’s midterm (40%) and final (60%) exam scores. It is designed to reinforce fundamental Java concepts such as variables, control structures, loops, and switch–case statements.

## ✨ Features

- Takes **course name**, **midterm score**, and **final score** from the user.
- For midterm and final scores:
  - Accepts only values in the **0–100** range.
  - Warns the user and requests re-entry if an invalid value is provided.
- Calculates the **term average** using the following formula:

  Average = midterm * 0.4 + final * 0.6

- Determines the letter grade based on the calculated average:
  - AA, BA, BB, CB, CC, DC, DD, FF
- Generates a short **description message** for each letter grade.
- Displays the results in a well-formatted output:
  - Course name
  - Midterm score
  - Final score
  - Average
  - Letter grade
  - Description
