# 📘 Arrays — Java Array Applications

This folder contains example applications designed to teach the fundamentals of working with **arrays in Java**.  
Each subproject focuses on a specific array-related problem and demonstrates how arrays can be combined with loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms.

As new examples are added, this README will be updated accordingly.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Understand how arrays store and organize data  
- Practice traversing arrays using loops  
- Apply mathematical and logical operations on array elements  
- Classify and analyze data stored in arrays  
- Reinforce algorithmic thinking with real examples  

---

## 📌 Current Examples

### ▶️ ArraySum
This example calculates the sum of elements in an integer array using a **for-each loop** and prints the result to the console.

Key concepts:
- Array definition and initialization  
- Accumulator variables  
- for-each loop traversal  

#### Sample Output
Array: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}  
Output:  
Array sum: 150

### ▶️ PrimeNumberAnalyzer
This project analyzes an array of integers entered by the user, classifies them as **prime** or **non-prime**, and calculates the **sum of each group**.

Key concepts:
- Dynamic array creation based on user input  
- Prime number checking logic  
- Nested loops  
- Conditional classification  
- Accumulating results for multiple categories  

#### Sample Output
Prime Numbers: 2 5 7  
Sum of Prime Numbers: 14  

Non-Prime Numbers: 4 6  
Sum of Non-Prime Numbers: 10

## 🚀 Future Additions

This folder will be expanded over time with additional array-based examples, such as:

- Average calculation  
- Finding the maximum / minimum value  
- Linear search algorithms  
- Dynamic array input and validation  
- Multidimensional array operations
