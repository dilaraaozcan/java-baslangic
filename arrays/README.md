# 📘 Arrays — Java Array Applications

This folder contains example applications designed to teach the fundamentals of working with arrays in Java. Currently, it includes only the first example, **Array Sum**. As new examples are added, this README will be updated accordingly.

---

## 📌 Current Example: Array Sum

This example calculates the sum of elements in an integer array using a for-each loop and prints the result to the console. It demonstrates core concepts such as array traversal and accumulation.

---

## 🔍 How the Logic Works

1. An integer array is defined.
2. A variable named `sum` is initialized to zero.
3. Each element of the array is added to `sum` using a for-each loop.
4. The final result is printed to the console.

## 💡 Sample Output

Array: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

Output:
Array sum: 150

## 🚀 Future Additions

This folder will be expanded over time with additional array-based examples, including:

- Average calculation
- Finding the maximum / minimum value
- Linear search
- Dynamic array input
- Multidimensional arrays
