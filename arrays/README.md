# 📘 Arrays — Java Array Applications

This folder contains example applications designed to teach the fundamentals of working with **arrays in Java**.  
Each subproject focuses on a specific array-related problem and demonstrates how arrays can be combined with loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms.

As new examples are added, this README will be updated accordingly.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Understand how arrays store and organize data  
- Practice traversing arrays using loops  
- Apply mathematical and logical operations on array elements  
- Classify, analyze, and summarize array data  
- Reinforce algorithmic thinking with real-world examples  

---

## 📌 Current Examples

---

### ▶️ ArraySum
Calculates the sum of elements in an integer array using a **for-each loop** and prints the result to the console.

Key concepts:
- Array definition and initialization  
- Accumulator variables  
- for-each loop traversal  

**Sample Output**
Array: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}  
Array sum: 150  

---

### ▶️ PrimeNumberAnalyzer
Analyzes an array of integers entered by the user, classifies them as **prime** or **non-prime**, and calculates the **sum of each group**.

Key concepts:
- Dynamic array creation  
- Prime number checking algorithm  
- Nested loops  
- Conditional classification  
- Group-based accumulation  

**Sample Output**
Prime Numbers: 2 5 7  
Sum of Prime Numbers: 14  

Non-Prime Numbers: 4 6  
Sum of Non-Prime Numbers: 10  

---

### ▶️ ArrayStatisticsAnalyzer
Performs a comprehensive analysis on a user-defined integer array and generates a detailed **array analysis report**.

The program calculates:
- Maximum value  
- Minimum value  
- Sum of elements  
- Average value  
- Duplicate elements (if any)

Key concepts:
- Dynamic array input  
- Enhanced for-each loop  
- Nested loops for duplicate detection  
- Statistical calculations  
- Formatted console output  

**Sample Output**
Maximum Value      : 9  
Minimum Value      : 3  
Sum of Numbers     : 32  
Average            : 5.33  
Duplicates         : 5 3
