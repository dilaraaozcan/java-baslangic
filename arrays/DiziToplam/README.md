# 📘 Array Sum — Java Array Program

This folder contains a basic example application that calculates the sum of elements in an integer array in Java.  
The main goal is to practice working with array structures (`int[]`) and the for-each loop.

---

## 🔍 How the Logic Works

1. An integer array is defined.
2. A variable named `sum` is initialized to 0.
3. Each element in the array is added to `sum using a for-each loop.
4. After the loop completes, the total sum is printed to the console.

This example provides an ideal structure for learning how to iterate over array elements.

## 🧠 Java Concepts Practiced

- Defining integer arrays (`int[]`)
- Using the for-each loop
- Cumulative addition (`sum += element`)
- Printing output to the console (`System.out.println`)

## 💡 Sample Execution

Array: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

Output:
Array sum: 150
